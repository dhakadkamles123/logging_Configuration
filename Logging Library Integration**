To implement a mechanism for configuring logging levels and file paths for each API, you can utilize a configuration file or environment variables. Here's how you can approach it:

1. Configuration File Approach**:
   - Create a configuration file (e.g., `logging_config.json`) where each API is configured with its logging settings.
   - Example `logging_config.json`:

{
  "apis": {
    "search_api": {
      "log_level": "info",
      "log_file_path": "/var/log/search_api.log"
    },
    "user_api": {
      "log_level": "debug",
      "log_file_path": "/var/log/user_api.log"
    },
   
  }
}
```

   - Your application can read this configuration file during startup and configure logging accordingly.

2. Environment Variables Approach**:
   - Define environment variables for each API to specify logging settings.
   - Example:

```
SEARCH_API_LOG_LEVEL=info
SEARCH_API_LOG_FILE_PATH=/var/log/search_api.log

USER_API_LOG_LEVEL=debug
USER_API_LOG_FILE_PATH=/var/log/user_api.log
```

   - Your application reads these environment variables and configures logging accordingly.

3. **Logging Library Integration**:
   - Depending on the programming language and logging library you're using, you can integrate the configuration mechanism provided by the logging library.
   - For example, in Python using the `logging` module, you can configure logging based on the settings retrieved from a configuration file or environment variables.

Here's a simplified Python example using the `logging` module:

```python
import logging
import json

def configure_logging():
    with open('logging_config.json') as f:
        config = json.load(f)

    for api, settings in config['apis'].items():
        logger = logging.getLogger(api)
        logger.setLevel(settings['log_level'])
        handler = logging.FileHandler(settings['log_file_path'])
        formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
        handler.setFormatter(formatter)
        logger.addHandler(handler)

# Example usage
configure_logging()
logger = logging.getLogger('search_api')
logger.info('This is an info message')
```

In this example, `configure_logging()` reads the logging configuration from the `logging_config.json` file and configures logging for each API accordingly. You can adapt this approach to suit your specific programming language and logging library.
